## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of MindTrack seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 📧 How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email**: Send details to [your-email@example.com] (replace with actual email)
2. **Subject Line**: Use "SECURITY: [Brief Description]"
3. **Include**: As much information as possible about the vulnerability

### 📋 What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: What an attacker could potentially do
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions of MindTrack are affected
- **Environment**: Your testing environment details
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include a minimal proof of concept

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within **48 hours** and will send a more detailed response within **7 days** indicating the next steps in handling your report.

After the initial reply to your report, we will:
- Keep you informed of the progress towards a fix
- May ask for additional information or guidance
- Notify you when the vulnerability is fixed

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Local Data Storage

MindTrack stores data locally using SQLite databases. Consider the following:

- **Database Location**: Databases are stored in the application directory
- **Encryption**: Currently, databases are not encrypted at rest
- **Access Control**: Relies on file system permissions

### External Service Integration

MindTrack integrates with external services:

- **API Keys**: Store API keys securely in configuration files
- **Network Communication**: Uses HTTPS for external API calls
- **Local Services**: Communicates with local services (LM Studio, Translation)

### Configuration Security

- **Sensitive Data**: API keys and endpoints are stored in App.config
- **File Permissions**: Ensure configuration files have appropriate permissions
- **Version Control**: Never commit sensitive configuration data

## 🔧 Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **API Keys**: Keep your API keys secure and don't share them
2. **Updates**: Keep MindTrack updated to the latest version
3. **Permissions**: Run MindTrack with minimal necessary permissions
4. **Network**: Be cautious when using on public networks

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate user input
2. **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries for database operations
3. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
4. **Dependencies**: Keep NuGet packages updated
5. **Code Review**: Review code for security issues before merging

## 🔍 Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Database Encryption**: SQLite databases are not encrypted
2. **Configuration Storage**: API keys stored in plain text in App.config
3. **Local Network Services**: Communication with local services is not encrypted

### Planned Improvements

- [ ] Database encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Secure configuration storage options
- [ ] Enhanced input validation
- [ ] Security audit of external dependencies
