## üìù Coding Standards

### C# Coding Conventions

Follow Microsoft's C# coding conventions:

```csharp
// Use PascalCase for public members
public class TaskManager
{
    public string TaskName { get; set; }
    
    public void AddTask(string description)
    {
        // Use camelCase for local variables
        var newTask = new Task(description);
        
        // Use meaningful names
        if (IsValidTask(newTask))
        {
            SaveToDatabase(newTask);
        }
    }
    
    // Use descriptive method names
    private bool IsValidTask(Task task)
    {
        return !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(task.Description);
    }
}
```

### Code Organization

- **One class per file**: Keep classes in separate files
- **Logical grouping**: Group related functionality together
- **Clear naming**: Use descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code

### Database Operations

```csharp
// Use proper disposal patterns
using (var connection = new SQLiteConnection(connectionString))
{
    connection.Open();
    // Database operations
}

// Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
var command = new SQLiteCommand(
    "INSERT INTO tasks (description, completed) VALUES (@desc, @completed)", 
    connection);
command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@desc", description);
command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@completed", false);
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing

Before submitting a PR, test:

1. **Core functionality**: Ensure all main features work
2. **Edge cases**: Test with empty inputs, large datasets, etc.
3. **UI responsiveness**: Check that the interface remains responsive
4. **Database operations**: Verify data is saved and retrieved correctly

### Test Scenarios

- **Task Management**: Create, edit, delete, and complete tasks
- **Focus Sessions**: Start, stop, and save focus sessions
- **Mood Tracking**: Record and view mood entries
- **Statistics**: Verify charts and data display correctly
- **AI Chat**: Test chat functionality (if LM Studio is available)
